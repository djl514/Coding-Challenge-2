# Coding-Challenge-2
Second Coding Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to create a bill splitter application, making functions to calculate the tip based on the bill amount. The main parameter for this was making sure that the tip was different if the bill was between a certain amount, and would change if the bill wasn't within that amount.
